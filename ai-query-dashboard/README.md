# AI Query Dashboard

A React-based dashboard prototype for an AI Analytics tool that demonstrates query interaction and result visualization.

## Features

- Natural language query input with AI-powered suggestions
- Query history tracking
- Real-time result visualization using charts
- Responsive design
- Redux state management
- Loading and error states

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for build tooling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-query-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

```

├── components/      # React components
├── store/          # Redux store and slices
├── utils/          # Utility functions
└── App.jsx         # Root component
```

## Implementation Approach

The dashboard implements a simulated AI query processing system that:
1. Accepts natural language queries
2. Processes them with simulated AI analysis
3. Returns visualized results based on query context
4. Maintains query history for reference

## State Management

The application uses Redux Toolkit for state management with:
- Query state management
- History tracking
- Loading states
- Error handling

## Deployment

The project is deployed on [Platform Name] and can be accessed at [URL].

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced error handling
- More visualization types
- Export functionality
- Advanced filtering options
